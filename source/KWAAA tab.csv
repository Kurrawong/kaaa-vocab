For example, a large number of Freedom of Information (FOI) files could be kept separate to the main filing system and be arranged by the surname of the applicant.

The CASES activity descriptor, attached to the relevant keyword, may be used if case file numbers are small enough to retain in the main filing system.

Also includes arrangements for staff travel and the provision of childcare by the agency.

See the Personnel Handbook for directions on the creation, maintenance, security and disposal of personal information. List personal files alphabetically by name or numerically by serial number. The files may be kept in a separate filing system.

See STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT for long term plans and policies regarding employees, such as Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) plans and Ethnic Affairs Policy Statements (EAPS).

Tip: If the organisation wants to specify the category of staff so that all files relating to the one category are grouped together, specify the category immediately after the relevant descriptor as a name in singular form, eg. PERSONNEL - EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS - Matron/Field Officer.

Tip: For travel arrangements, the relevant keyword and activity descriptor may be used, eg. STAFF DEVELOPMENT - CONFERENCES. PERSONNEL - ARRANGEMENTS - Travel may be used if the organisation wishes to document copies of all travel arrangements on one file. Add the name of individual staff members as free text if required.
